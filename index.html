            <p>For instance, in one study, young children were more likely to help others when they had been identified
                as “being a helper.” Another study found that when people gave away something that represented their
                essence, such as a signature, personal possession, or blood donation, they were more committed to
                helping the cause in the future compared to people who gave something less personal.</p>
